Large freshwater lakes play an important role in the earthâ€™s ecosystems, not only because they
contain 68% of the global freshwater reservoir, but also because of their economic, social, and
biological importance as they provide habitats for wildlife, irrigation for agriculture, energy,
transport and most importantly water for drinking. So, Water quality monitoring in the surface
water is important to obtain quantitative information on the water's characteristics. However, the
large aerial extent of some of these waters makes traditional water monitoring time and
resource consuming, hence inefficient. An alternative method to monitor water quality is by
using satellite imagery which is one kind of remote sensing. In this project, among all possible
water surfaces, lakes are chosen to be investigated and all chosen lakes are located in the
province of British Columbia.

# Platforms 
- Arbutus
- Colab
